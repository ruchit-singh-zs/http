1. Use Cases:

    json.Unmarshal is ideal for:
    - Small to medium-sized JSON payloads.
    - Situations where you can load the entire JSON data into memory.
    - Simpler applications where ease of use is a priority.

    json.Decoder is ideal for:
    - Large JSON payloads or streaming data.
    - Situations where JSON data is read from a file, network connection, or any io.Reader.
    - Applications requiring efficient memory usage and the ability to handle JSON data incrementally.

2. Memory Management:
- json.Unmarshal loads the entire JSON data into memory before processing, which can be memory-intensive for large JSON payloads.
- json.Decoder reads and processes JSON data incrementally, allowing for efficient memory usage, especially useful for large or continuous streams of JSON data.

3. Performance:
- json.Unmarshal is generally faster for small to medium-sized JSON payloads due to its simplicity.
- json.Decoder provides better performance for large JSON payloads by avoiding the need to load the entire data into memory.


4. Flexibility:
- json.Unmarshal is less flexible in terms of handling JSON data incrementally but is very straightforward for simple use cases.
- json.Decoder offers more flexibility for handling complex JSON parsing scenarios, such as decoding multiple JSON objects from a single stream or processing JSON tokens individually.



## IMPORTANT

The json package uses map[string]interface{} and []interface{} values to store arbitrary JSON objects and arrays; it will happily unmarshal any valid JSON blob into a plain interface{} value. The default concrete Go types are:

- bool for JSON booleans,
- float64 for JSON numbers,
- string for JSON strings, and
- nil for JSON null.


```go
type FamilyMember struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
    Parents []string
}

var m FamilyMember
err := json.Unmarshal(b, &m)

//Unmarshaling that data into a FamilyMember value works as expected, but if we look closely we can see a remarkable thing has happened. With the var statement we allocated a FamilyMember struct, and then provided a pointer to that value to Unmarshal, but at that time the Parents field was a nil slice value. To populate the Parents field, Unmarshal allocated a new slice behind the scenes. This is typical of how Unmarshal works with the supported reference types (pointers, slices, and maps).

// Consider unmarshaling into this data structure:

type Foo struct {
    Bar *Bar
}

//If there were a Bar field in the JSON object, Unmarshal would allocate a new Bar and populate it. If not, Bar would be left as a nil pointer.
