1. Use Cases:
- json.Marshal is ideal for:
    - Encoding a Go value into a JSON byte slice.
    - Scenarios where you need to manipulate or log the JSON data before sending it.
    - Simpler applications where the data size is manageable and held in memory.

- json.Encoder is ideal for:
    - Streaming JSON data directly to a writer, such as a file, network connection, or HTTP response.
    - Handling large JSON payloads efficiently without holding the entire data in memory.
    - Real-time applications where you are writing JSON data as it is generated or received.

2. Memory Management:
- json.Marshal holds the entire JSON data in memory as a byte slice, which can be less efficient for very large data.
- json.Encoder writes JSON data incrementally to an io.Writer, which is more memory-efficient for large data or continuous streams.


3. Performance:
- json.Marshal is generally faster for small to medium-sized data due to its simplicity but can be less efficient for very large data.
- json.Encoder provides better performance for large or streaming data by avoiding the need to create and hold a complete JSON byte slice.

4. Flexibility:
- json.Marshal provides flexibility in terms of manipulating or logging JSON data before use.
- json.Encoder offers direct output to writers and is useful for streaming data scenarios.



## IMPORTANT

Only data structures that can be represented as valid JSON will be encoded:

- JSON objects only support strings as keys; to encode a Go map type it must be of the form map[string]T (where T is any Go type supported by the json package).
- Channel, complex, and function types cannot be encoded.
- Cyclic data structures are not supported; they will cause Marshal to go into an infinite loop.
- Pointers will be encoded as the values they point to (or ’null’ if the pointer is nil).
